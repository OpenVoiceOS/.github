# OpenVoiceOS
A community powered Linux distribution, purpose-built with buildroot to showcase the power of Open Source Voice AI for a range of devices.

## About
OpenVoiceOS is a minimalistic linux OS bringing the open source voice assistant Mycroft A.I. to embbeded, low-spec headless and/or small (touch)screen devices.

## Get Involved

At this moment development is in very early stages and focussed on the Raspberry Pi 3B & 4. As soon as an initial first workable version is created, other hardware might be added.
