# Introduction
OpenVoiceOS provides an alternative to proprietary voice assistant platforms such as platforms offered by major companies like Amazon, Google, and Apple. The voice commands given to these assistants are often sent and stored in the cloud. This data can include personal and sensitive information that users might not want to be stored long-term or accessible to third parties. The collected data can be used to create detailed profiles of users' habits, preferences, and routines. This information can be used for targeted advertising or other commercial purposes, hence the real reason in our oppinion for these devices to be on the market. Voice assistants can be triggered accidentally by sounds similar to the wake word, leading to unintended recording of private conversations. There have been instances where human reviewers listen to voice recordings to improve the service, raising concerns about who has access to these recordings and how they are used.

These privacy issues highlight the need for a more transparent, user-controlled, and privacy-respecting alternative. The OpenVoiceOS project aims to provide an open-source, privacy-focused, and community-driven voice assistant framework and operating system. 

Here are some key aspects of the OpenVoiceOS project:
- **Control and Ownership:** OpenVoiceOS, being open-source, allows users full access to the source code. This transparency lets users and developers inspect, understand, modify, and control every aspect of the voice assistant.
- **Privacy and Data Security:** OpenVoiceOS can be configured to process data locally on the user's device or the user’s local network, minimizing the need to send sensitive information over the internet and enhancing privacy.
- **Innovation and Community Contributions:** OpenVoiceOS benefits from contributions from a global community of developers. This collective effort can lead to faster innovation features including third party innovative solutions and rapid problem- and bug solving.
